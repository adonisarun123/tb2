# Search Optimization & Enhancement Guide

## Overview
The AI Search Widget has been significantly enhanced with better result relevance, new tab functionality, and improved user experience. This guide explains the optimizations and new features.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Hierarchical Search Algorithm
**NEW: Long-tail Keyword Support**

The search now implements a 3-level hierarchical approach for complex queries:

#### Level 1: Exact Phrase Matching (Highest Priority - 50+ points)
- Searches for the complete query string first
- Example: "Outdoor adventure team building games" â†’ looks for exact phrase
- Bonus: +20 points for any exact phrase match found

#### Level 2: Multi-word Combinations (Medium Priority - 20-35 points)
- Generates all possible word combinations from the query
- Example: "Outdoor adventure team building games" generates:
  - "outdoor adventure team building"
  - "adventure team building games"
  - "outdoor adventure team"
  - "team building games"
  - etc.
- Scores decrease with combination length for relevance

#### Level 3: Individual Keywords (Lowest Priority - 2-10 points)
- Falls back to individual word matching
- Only used when phrase and combination matching don't yield sufficient results

**Example: "Outdoor adventure team building games"**

1. **Level 1**: Searches for exact phrase "outdoor adventure team building games"
2. **Level 2**: Searches for combinations like:
   - "outdoor adventure team building" (25 points)
   - "adventure team building games" (23 points)
   - "outdoor adventure team" (21 points)
   - "team building games" (19 points)
   - "outdoor adventure" (17 points)
   - "adventure team" (15 points)
   - etc.
3. **Level 3**: Individual keywords: "outdoor", "adventure", "team", "building", "games"
